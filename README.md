# in1box-desktop

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Currently only runs on OS X. Linux and Windows soon. Requires Node & NPM.

### Installing
Git clone or download the zip. Then,

```
cd 'path/to/directory'
npm run dev
```

##### A note on using the Google APIs

You currently have to paste or move the client_secret.json into the app's credentials folder (currently at ~/Library/Application Support/in1box-desktop/credentials/google). This should change soon.
